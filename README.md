<b> Overview </b> 
</p>
<p align=left>
With the start of #100DaysOfMLCode challenge this Machine Learning Goodness repository will be updated daily with either 
the completed Jupyter notebooks, Python codes, ML projects, useful ML/DL libraries, cheat codes of ML/DL, useful information 
such as websites, beneficial learning materials, tips and whatnot not to mention some basic and advanced Python coding.

## Worthy Tools
[(Back to top)](#table-of-contents)

Worthy websites and tools that include cheat codes for Python, Machine Learning, Deep Learning, Neural Networks and what not apart from other
worthy tools like GitHub repositories or books while you are learning or honing your skills can be found here. Updated constantly when a worthy material is found
to be shared on the repository.

## Notebooks 
[(Back to top)](#table-of-contents)

Done notebooks of various datasets can be found [here](https://github.com/aurimas13/Machine-Learning-Goodness/tree/main/Notebooks).

# Notes
[(Back to top)](#table-of-contents)

Additional notes that we covered through lectures or additional material that I said about can be found 
[here](https://github.com/aurimas13/Machine-Learning-Goodness/tree/main/Notes).

# Public
[(Back to top)](#table-of-contents)

Public folder contains two files: 
- [todolist](https://github.com/aurimas13/Machine-Learning-Goodness/blob/main/Public/todolist.txt) - the TO DO List.
- [logo](https://github.com/aurimas13/Machine-Learning-Goodness/tree/main/Public/Photo) - the Photo folder.


## Jupyter in Browser
[(Back to top)](#table-of-contents)

First nice thing is that you could run Jupyter also through browser by doing so going [here](https://jupyterlite.github.io/demo/lab/index.html) and 
reading more about it in this [article](https://medium.com/geekculture/run-jupyter-notebooks-on-a-web-browser-using-jupyterlite-18e3bd25bd97).

If you find difficulty in running Jupyter Notebook through Browser then you could use Google Colab by clicking 
[here](https://colab.research.google.com/notebooks/intro.ipynb). Functionalities of both machines are similar.
